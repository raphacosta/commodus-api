:description: features in future versions

Roadmap
-------

We're currently planning and improving on new features, even if they are not listed here.
Features which might influence the overall performance or cause greater changes should be discussed in a feature request before.

At Commodus we implement new functions as we need them and push them as soon as they are somewhat stable.

Todo
==============
   - Review and improve tests
   - Improve Caching

Future Features
===============
   - possibility to store events (values table) in noSQL systems
   - implement callback for time-aware achievements
   - out-of-portal statistics display
   - maybe a possiblity to plugin authentication/authorization to allow users to directly push events to the engine
     - this still needs to be discussed from an architectural point of view
     - this would also introduce the need for security constraints to detect cheaters
